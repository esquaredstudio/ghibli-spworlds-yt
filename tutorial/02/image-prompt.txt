Perfect top-down view straight down, Studio Ghibli style illustration. Rolling verdant hills stretching across the landscape, primarily covered in lush, bright green grass. Several pale dirt paths winding through the hills. A few scattered trees with diverse shades of green dot the landscape, appearing as soft, rounded canopies from above. Subtle mountain peaks are visible in the distance. Soft, even lighting from directly above, ensuring no side shadows. An abstract composition of organic shapes and lines seen strictly from above
